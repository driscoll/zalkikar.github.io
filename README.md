# The Gender Binary of Computing: Challenging Sexism in Technology

My [article](https://zalkikar.github.io/) explores the role of gender in early computing history (1970-1980) through the analysis of computer hobbyist letters published in Byte magazine. 

This repo contains R code used for exploratory data analysis (summary statistics, basic visuals, thematic clustering) of hobbyist letters and the thematic elements they contain. It also contains an Excel table with letter data (information such as author name and address, editor reply, issue published, and theme counts). Each figure.png in the repo corresponds to a letter of interest in the article.

This research was conducted at the University of Virginia with mentorship from [Professor Kevin Driscoll](http://kevindriscoll.info/).
