## The Gender Binary of Computing: Challenging Sexism in Technology 

Modern movements that combat instances of institutionalized sexism and gender disparity in the computing industry are the heart and soul of a larger, global force empowering women that continue to be marginalized in long-standing patriarchies. My essay will shed light on a key turning point in the history of technology that demonstrates how today's discussion of sexism and misogyny are long overdue.

The late 1970s were humble years for the personal computing industry as microcomputers gradually transitioned from a hobbyist fancy to a mainstream tool, but nonetheless, they were critical for shaping how computers would spread during the 1980s. This growth was facilitated by communications between computer hobbyists across the continental United States and beyond, and one particularly powerful segment of these communications were through computing magazines.

*Byte* magazine was one of the most widely circulated magazines of its kind, reaching an estimated circulation of about [420,000 (third highest of all computer magazines) in the early 1980s](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/09/business/boom-in-computer-magazines.html). This analysis focuses on *Byte's* beginnings, a time where hobbyists discussed ideas, sought help, shared opinions, and planned club events about computing technology. The average hobbyist was relatively young (students to middle-aged adults), relatively wealthy (middle to upper-middle class), and predominantly white.

You might be wondering, was the average 1970s computer hobbyist also a *male*?
